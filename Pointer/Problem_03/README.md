# * Problem 03 :

Write a program in C to demonstrate the use of the &( address of ) and *( value at address )  operators.  

## * Expected Output :

Pointer : Demonstrate the use of & and * operator :  
____________________________________________________

            m = 300  
            fx = 300.600006  
            cht = z  

Using & operator :

            address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8   
            address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc  
            address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7  
                                                                                                              
Using & and * operator :

            value at address of m = 300  
            value at address of fx = 300.600006   
            value at address of cht = z    


Using only pointer variable :

            address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8 
            address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc 
            address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7  
                                                                                                
Using only pointer operator :
