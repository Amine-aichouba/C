## * Problem 11 :

Write a program in C to swap elements using call by reference.

## * Test Data :

        Input the value of 1st element : 5
        Input the value of 2nd element : 6
        Input the value of 3rd element : 7

## * Expected Output :

The value before swapping are :         

        element 1 = 5                                                                
        element 2 = 6                                                                      
        element 3 = 7                                                             
                                   
The value after swapping are :                                                            

        element 1 = 7                                                                          
        element 2 = 5                                              
        element 3 = 6
