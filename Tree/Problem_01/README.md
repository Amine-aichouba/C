# * Problem 01 :

Write a C program that creates a binary tree. Allow users to input nodes and build a binary tree structure.

## * Expected Output :

    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree : 1
    
    * Want to insert another node? [Y/n]: y
    
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree : 2
    
    * Want to insert another node? [Y/n]: y
    
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree : 3
    
    * Want to insert another node? [Y/n]: y
    
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree : 4
    
    * Want to insert another node? [Y/n]: n
    
    
    * In-order traversal :  1  2  3  4
