# * Problem 04 :

Write a C program that implements a deletion function for a binary tree. Allow users to delete nodes while maintaining the binary search tree structure.

## * Expected Output :

    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 2
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 3
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 4
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 5
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 0
    
    
    * In-order traversal :  2  3  4  5 
    
    
    * Enter a value to delete from the binary search tree [enter 0 to stop]: 2
    
    
    * In-order Traversal after deleting 2 :  3  4  5 
    
    * Enter a value to delete from the binary search tree [enter 0 to stop]: 4
    
    
    * In-order Traversal after deleting 4 :  3  5 
    
    * Enter a value to delete from the binary search tree [enter 0 to stop]: 5
    
    
    * In-order Traversal after deleting 5 :  3
