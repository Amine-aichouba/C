# * Problem 05 :

 Write a C program to create a mirror image of a binary tree. Print both the original and mirrored trees.

 ## * Expected Output :

    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 1
    
    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 2
    
    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 3
    
    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 4
    
    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 5
    
    * Enter a item to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 0
    
    
    * Original Binary Tree (In-order Traversal):  1  2  3  4  5 
    
    * Mirrored Binary Tree (In-order Traversal):  5  4  3  2  1
