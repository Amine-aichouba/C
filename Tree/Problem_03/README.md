# * Problem 03 :

 Write a C program to calculate the height of a binary tree. Ensure the program handles empty trees gracefully

## * Expected Output :

    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 5
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 4
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 3
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 6
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 7
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 8
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 0
    
    
    * Height of the Binary Tree : 4
