# * Problem 02 :

 Write a C program to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Print the elements in sorted order.

## * Expected Output :

    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 1
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 2
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 3
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 4
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 5
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 6
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 7
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 8
    
    * Enter a value to insert into the binary tree [enter 0 to stop]: 0
    
    
    * In-order traversal :  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
