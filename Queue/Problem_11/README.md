# * Problem 11 :

Write a C program to delete the nth element of a queue.
Firstly, this code checks if the queue is empty or if the position to delete is invalid. If the position is valid, it deletes the first n-1 elements, then deletes the nth element by calling the dequeue () function.

## * Expected Output :

    * Insert some elements into the queue 
    
    * Queue elements are :  1  2  3  4  5 
    
    
    * Delete the 7th element of the said queue 
    
    * Error : Invalid position
    
    
    * Delete the 3th element of the said queue 
    
    * Queue elements are :  4  5
