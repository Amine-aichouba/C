Write a C program to compute the average value of the elements in a queue.

## * Expected Output :

    * Queue elements are :  1  2  3  4  5 
    
    * Average of the elements in the queue is : 3.000000 
    
    
    * Remove 2 elements from the said queue 
    
    * Queue elements are :  3  4  5 
    
    * Average of the elements in the queue is : 4.000000 
    
    
    * Insert 3 more elements 
    
    * Queue elements are :  3  4  5  300  427  519 
    
    * Average of the elements in the queue is : 209.666672
