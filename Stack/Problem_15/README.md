## * Expected Output :

    * Elements of the stack :   7  4  5  2  3  1
    
    * Minimum value of the said stack : 1 
    
    * Elements of the stack after removing the said minimum value 
    
    
    * Elements of the stack :   7  4  5  2  3
    
    * Minimum value of the said stack : 2 
    
    * Elements of the stack after removing the said minimum value 
    
    
    * Elements of the stack :   7  4  5  3
    
    * Minimum value of the said stack : 3 
    
    * Elements of the stack after removing the said minimum value
